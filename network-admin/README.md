# efpb-network-admin

## Network admin interface

This file is responsible for generating EFP Settings menu slug on Network level. It creates blank page where other plugins can place their settings.

In order to add section for another plugin it is necessary to add code to efp_render_network_settings() and efp_save_settings() too.
